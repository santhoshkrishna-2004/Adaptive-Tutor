      "The main advantage of arrays is constant-time access to elements. However, insertion and deletion can be expensive as they may require shifting elements.",
      "Arrays are ideal when you need fast random access to elements and when the size of your data is relatively fixed."
    ],
    "linked lists": [
      "Linked lists are dynamic data structures where elements (nodes) are stored in arbitrary memory locations and connected via pointers.",
      "Unlike arrays, linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion at any position (O(1) if you have the reference), but accessing elements requires traversal (O(n)).",
      "Linked lists are perfect when you frequently insert/delete elements and don't need random access to elements."

      "Common stack operations are push (add element), pop (remove element), and peek/top (view top element). All operations are O(1).",
      "Stacks are used in function calls, expression evaluation, undo operations, and backtracking algorithms."
    ],
    "queues": [
      "Queues follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, like a line of people waiting - first person in line is served first.",
      "Basic queue operations include enqueue (add to rear), dequeue (remove from front), and front/rear (view elements). All are O(1) in a well-implemented queue.",
      "Queues are essential in breadth-first search, scheduling algorithms, and handling requests in web servers."
    ],
    "trees": [
      "Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Each node can have multiple children but only one parent.",
      "Binary trees are special trees where each node has at most 2 children. Binary Search Trees (BST) maintain sorted order for efficient searching.",

    "searching": [
      "Linear search checks each element sequentially (O(n)), while binary search works on sorted arrays by eliminating half the search space each time (O(log n)).",

      "Database normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity by organizing data into related tables.",
      "First Normal Form (1NF) eliminates repeating groups, Second Normal Form (2NF) removes partial dependencies, Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates transitive dependencies.",
      "While normalization reduces redundancy, sometimes denormalization is used for performance optimization in read-heavy applications."
    ],
    "indexing": [
      "Database indexes are data structures that improve query performance by creating shortcuts to data, similar to an index in a book.",
      "B-tree indexes are most common and work well for range queries. Hash indexes are faster for exact matches but don't support range queries.",

      "Understanding the OSI model helps troubleshoot network issues by identifying which layer might be causing problems."
    ],
    "tcp/ip": [
      "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is reliable and connection-oriented, ensuring all data arrives in order. UDP is faster but doesn't guarantee delivery.",
